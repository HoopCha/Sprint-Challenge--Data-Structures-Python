# We have to do this recursivly, so ideally in just one pass
# We will want a pointer called current, that points at the head to start
# It checks the first 2 rules and finds neither will run, so then runs recursion on the next element.
# This continues until the pointer is pointing at 3. in which case it can run the 2nd argument, and turns 3 into the head
# then we go back up the call stack, where we grab the next node and set its next to the current node, in this case
# setting three to point to 2, and then we kill the connection of two pointing to three, finish the whole stack and its reversed!

#Lingering questions: why does reverse list call for previous? The tests never use it.
